# Discord BF File Monitor
This is a simple monitoring program to check if you are infected with the Blueface malware on Discord.

## Usage
Just start the Program.  
It first checks for the malware and after that checks every 5 minutes.  
If it found malicious code you can click on "CLEANSE" and the malicious code will get removed.

## Disclaimer
I designed this program with the information posted [here](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-turned-into-an-info-stealing-backdoor-by-new-malware/). I will not take any responsibilities if Blueface still infects you and causes harm after all!
